Event Management System (Oracle SQL)
Overview

This project implements a fully functional Event Management System in Oracle SQL.
It demonstrates database design, automation through triggers, referential integrity, and data reporting.
The system models real-world entities such as events, venues, organizers, customers, tickets, and payments.

The script performs a complete lifecycle of database operations:

Cleans up existing objects

Creates sequences, tables, and triggers

Inserts sample data

Implements constraints and capacity management

Generates analytical reports and a summary view

Features
 Database Objects

Tables: VENUE, ORGANIZER, EVENT, CUSTOMER, TICKET, PAYMENT

Sequences: Auto-incrementing ID generators for each table

Triggers:

Automatic ID assignment

Venue capacity checks before booking

Capacity update after ticket insertion

Cascade delete enforcement between EVENT → TICKET

 Views

vw_OrganizerPaymentSummary:
Aggregates total revenue generated by each event organizer.

Schema Design
Table	Description	Key Columns
VENUE	Stores event locations and capacities	VenueID, VenueName, Capacity, AvailableCapacity
ORGANIZER	Event organizer information	OrganizerID, FullName, Email
EVENT	Details of scheduled events	EventID, OrganizerID, VenueID, Title, EventDate, Category
CUSTOMER	Customer details	CustomerID, FullName, Email, City
TICKET	Ticket sales and status	TicketID, EventID, CustomerID, Price, Status
PAYMENT	Payment transactions	PaymentID, TicketID, Amount, Method
 Automation Logic
Trigger	Table	Purpose
TRG_VENUE_ID	VENUE	Auto-generate VenueID
TRG_ORGANIZER_ID	ORGANIZER	Auto-generate OrganizerID
TRG_EVENT_ID	EVENT	Auto-generate EventID
TRG_CUSTOMER_ID	CUSTOMER	Auto-generate CustomerID
TRG_TICKET_ID	TICKET	Auto-generate TicketID
TRG_PAYMENT_ID	PAYMENT	Auto-generate PaymentID
TRG_BEFORETICKETINSERT_CHECKCAPACITY	TICKET	Prevent booking if venue is full
TRG_AFTERTICKETINSERT_UPDATECAPACITY	TICKET	Decrease venue capacity after booking
Reports & Queries
1. Tickets Sold Per Event with Revenue

Displays the total number of tickets sold and total revenue per event.

SELECT E.Title AS EventTitle,
       COUNT(T.TicketID) AS TicketsSold,
       NVL(SUM(P.Amount), 0) AS TotalRevenue
FROM Event E
LEFT JOIN Ticket T ON E.EventID = T.EventID
LEFT JOIN Payment P ON T.TicketID = P.TicketID
GROUP BY E.Title
ORDER BY EventTitle;

2.  Most Attended Event per Category

Identifies the most popular event in each category based on ticket sales.

SELECT Category, EventTitle, NumberOfTicketsSold
FROM (
    SELECT E.Category,
           E.Title AS EventTitle,
           COUNT(T.TicketID) AS NumberOfTicketsSold,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
               PARTITION BY E.Category ORDER BY COUNT(T.TicketID) DESC
           ) AS rn
    FROM Event E
    LEFT JOIN Ticket T ON E.EventID = T.EventID
    WHERE T.Status IN ('Booked', 'Confirmed')
    GROUP BY E.Category, E.Title
)
WHERE rn = 1
ORDER BY Category;

3.  Organizer Payment Summary View

Shows each organizer’s total generated revenue.

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW vw_OrganizerPaymentSummary AS
SELECT
    O.FullName AS OrganizerName,
    O.Company AS OrganizerCompany,
    NVL(SUM(P.Amount), 0) AS TotalRevenueGenerated
FROM ORGANIZER O
LEFT JOIN EVENT E ON O.OrganizerID = E.OrganizerID
LEFT JOIN TICKET T ON E.EventID = T.EventID
LEFT JOIN PAYMENT P ON T.TicketID = P.TicketID
GROUP BY O.FullName, O.Company
ORDER BY TotalRevenueGenerated DESC;

 Key Highlights

Data Integrity: Enforced through foreign keys and cascade deletes

Automation: Trigger-based capacity control prevents overbooking

Scalability: Sequences handle unique IDs across all tables

Reusability: Views simplify analytical queries

Demonstration-ready: Includes sample data for venues, organizers, events, and customers

Testing
Capacity Enforcement Example

Manually reduce venue capacity.

Attempt to book tickets beyond capacity.

The trigger automatically blocks overbooking and shows an Oracle error.

 Verification Queries

You can verify final data with:

SELECT * FROM Venue;
SELECT * FROM Organizer;
SELECT * FROM Event;
SELECT * FROM Customer;
SELECT * FROM Ticket;
SELECT * FROM Payment;


Check remaining capacities:

SELECT VenueName, Capacity, AvailableCapacity,
       (Capacity - AvailableCapacity) AS TicketsBooked
FROM Venue
ORDER BY VenueName;

 Conclusion

This script showcases a complete database design and automation example for managing events, tickets, payments, and venue capacities using Oracle PL/SQL.
It demonstrates both theoretical understanding and practical database engineering skills, ideal for coursework or professional demonstration.
